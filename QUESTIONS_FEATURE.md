   - Support for both single and multiple choice questions
   - Navigation between questions with visual progress indicators
   - Form validation and submission handling
   - Responsive design with modern UI

2. **Updated App Routing** (`/frontend/src/App.js`)

4. **API Service** (`/frontend/src/services/api.js`)

### Backend API Endpoints

   - No authentication required for questions (public endpoint)
   - Returns structured question data with options

2. **POST /api/assessments/submit-answers**

### Database Schema

  "user_id": "string",
  "answers": {
    "1": "Bachelor's Degree",
    "2": ["Technology/Software Development", "Healthcare"],
    "3": "2-3 years (Junior)",
    "4": "Remote work",
    "5": ["Programming/Coding", "Data Analysis"]
  },

}
```
