   - Protected route requiring authentication
   - Returns structured recommendation data

### Frontend Integration

1. **Recommendations Component** (`/frontend/src/components/Recommendations.js`)
   - Displays AI-generated course recommendations
   - Shows career path, skill gaps, and learning path
   - Interactive course cards with detailed information
   - Priority and difficulty indicators
   - Next steps guidance

2. **Updated Questions Flow**
   - Questions submission now triggers recommendation generation
   - Success page includes link to view recommendations

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Gemini Pro API Integration

```python
# Gemini Service Configuration
class GeminiService:
    def __init__(self):
        self.api_key = os.getenv('GEMINI_API_KEY')
        genai.configure(api_key=self.api_key)
        self.model = genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-pro')
```

### Prompt Engineering

The system uses a structured prompt to get consistent, useful recommendations:

```python
prompt = f"""
You are a career guidance expert AI assistant. Based on the following student assessment responses, provide personalized course recommendations.

STUDENT PROFILE:
- Education Level: {education_level}
- Career Interests: {career_interests}
- Work Experience: {work_experience}
- Preferred Work Environment: {work_environment}
- Current Skills: {skills}

Please provide course recommendations in the following JSON format:
{{
    "career_path": "Recommended career path",
    "skill_gaps": ["List of skills to develop"],
    "courses": [
        {{
            "title": "Course Title",
            "description": "Course description",
            "category": "Technical/Soft Skills/Business",
            "difficulty": "Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced",
            "duration": "Estimated duration",
            "platform": "Learning platform",
            "priority": "High/Medium/Low",
            "reason": "Why this course is recommended"
        }}
    ],
    "learning_path": "Step-by-step progression",
    "next_steps": ["Immediate actions"]
}}
"""
```
